Dark basement

You are in a dim basement, lit only by the pale glow of the computer screen.
It has been days since you have seen the sun.

Main floor, Computer, Furnace room

sock, bag of chips

Eww! That's smelly!, All dressed are the best

###
Main floor

You are on the main floor of the house. It is raining outside, but there is
an interesting smell coming from the kitchen.

Dark basement, Kitchen

keys

Wonder what this opens?

###
Kitchen

Mmmmmm, coffee!

Main floor, Dark basement

steaming mug of joe

That's what I needed

###
Computer

You see a screen with a blinking cursor. It is waiting for your command.
In fact, it is waiting for you to type `exit`.

Exit

power button

Time for sleep

###
Furnace room

What a mess! You can't even see the furnace for all the junk in here.
Oh wait! Is that my old skateboard?

Dark basement

skateboard, broken electronics box

I should take this for a ride, I'm sure this will come in handy one day
